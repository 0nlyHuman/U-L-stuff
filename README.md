U-L-stuff Initial build including some enlightenment desktop related files and rpms for Unity-Linux (and mageia6)
ie: enlightenment 0.22.0 and 
efl-1.20.5 hopefully built with wayland support though untested, and a stable release of enlightenment 0.21.10 which was also built wayland support, with an added dependency for wayland-devel, so have rebuilt  0.22.0 with it also.

The default-blue-OHmod.edj file is a simple mod of the default theme from efl-1.20.4 it just has a blue menu and blue wallpaper, so will show bryce and luncher if used, though possibly not newer e 22

These are for my use, it is not advised that anyone else try using anything here, if you do it will be entirely at your own risk, I accept no responsibility for any use of the rpms and files here.
