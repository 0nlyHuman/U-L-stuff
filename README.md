U-L-stuff Initial build including some enlightenment desktop related files and rpms for Unity-Linux (and possibly mageia6)
ie: enlightenment 0.22.0-beta and efl-1.20.4 hopefully built with wayland support though untested, and an older stable release of enlightenment 0.21.9 which was built without any wayland support.
The for my use, it is not advised that anyone else try using anything here, if you do it will be entirely at your own risk, I accept no responsibility for any use of the rpms and files here.
